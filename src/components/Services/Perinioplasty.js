				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>
				During childbirth, it is common for women to experience a tearing or purposeful cutting of the perineum which is the area between the vaginal opening and the anus for easier delivery. 
				This tearing of the perineum can cause a widening of the perineum which some women find aesthetically unpleasing. 
				A teared perineum can also cause scarring which can make subsequent deliveries difficult and make vaginal sex uncomfortable. 
				For women who desire a tighter appearance to the perineum for either aesthetic or health reasons, a perineoplasty, also called a perineorrhaphy, can be performed. 
				A teared perineum can also cause scarring which can make subsequent deliveries difficult and make vaginal sex uncomfortable. 
				For women who desire a tighter appearance to the perineum for either aesthetic or health reasons, a perineoplasty, also called a perineorrhaphy, can be performed. 
				A perineoplasty typically only requires local anesthesia and is done on an outpatient basis. 
				Patients may be prescribed a sedative for improved comfort throughout the procedure. 
				Excess skin and any scar tissue is excised. 
				The vaginal levator muscles are tightened. 
				Internal and external closure of the vaginal mucous and perineal muscles are performed to achieve a tighter appearance and function of the perineum. 
				Results are noticeable immediately after the 30-45 minute procedure. 
				The goal of a perineoplasty is to repair tissue in the area from the vaginal opening to the anus, tightening muscle and skin to address vaginal laxity and be more aesthetically pleasing.
